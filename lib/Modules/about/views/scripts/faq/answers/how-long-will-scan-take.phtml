<h1>How long will the scan take ?</h1>
<p>
	A ScanMeNow with all Nessus plugins can take up to 45 minutes (or longer) to complete.

	Let's hope you never have to endure a 45 minute wait. If you do, it usually is related to
	the firewall on your computer silently dropping the packets we are sending you.
