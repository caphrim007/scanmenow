<h1>What browsers are supported ?</h1>
<p>
	ScanMeNow has been tested with basically everything we can get our hands on.
</p>
<p>
	This includes, but is not limited to
	<ul class='prepend-1'>
		<li>Internet Explorer
		<li>Firefox
		<li>Safari
		<li>Mozilla
		<li>Chrome
		<li>wget
		<li>elinks
		<li>cURL
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	If it talks HTTP, it probably works just fine.
